
OP1.If we want to display acccording to age and their count in descending order-
select age,count(*) [Count] from [dbo].[Depression Student Dataset]
group by age 
order by age desc

OP2.We want to add one more coloumn that should tell us in age groups:(here range of age is 18-34, for that we need to add a new coloumn  Age_Group)-
alter table [dbo].[Depression Student Dataset]
add Age_Group varchar(max)

select * from [dbo].[Depression Student Dataset]

update [dbo].[Depression Student Dataset]
set age_group =
case when Age between 18 and 24 then 'A1'
Else case when age between 25 and 30 then 'A2'
else 'A3' end end


OP3:count of the record for each distinct for each one of distinct values :
select age_group,count(*) from [dbo].[Depression Student Dataset]
group by age_group
